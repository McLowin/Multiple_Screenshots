  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 25, 2025</p>

  <p>
    This privacy policy explains how the Chrome extension <strong>Multiple Screenshots</strong> ("the Extension", "we", "our") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our services.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    The Extension only stores the minimum necessary data to deliver its Premium functionality. Specifically:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Email address:</strong> entered by the user during license activation, stored locally in your browser.</li>
    <li><strongLicense token:</strong> also stored locally and used for verifying license validity via a secure request to <a href="https://www.lemonsqueezy.com" target="_blank">Lemon Squeezy</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. What We Do NOT Collect</h2>
  <p>We explicitly do NOT collect, transmit, or share any of the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Browsing history or visited URLs</li>
    <li>Contents of visited websites</li>
    <li>Captured screenshots</li>
    <li>XPath targets or user-defined settings</li>
    <li>Any personally identifiable information (PII) not explicitly provided</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Screenshot Data</h2>
  <p>
    All screenshots captured using the Extension are processed locally on your device. We do not have access to your screenshots, and they are not uploaded or sent to any external servers.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Use of Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    We rely on <strong>Lemon Squeezy</strong> as our third-party license provider. Your license key and email are securely verified against their API to activate Premium features. No payment information or personal data is handled by the Extension — all transactions occur directly between you and Lemon Squeezy.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>
    All information is stored locally using the Chrome Extension's `chrome.storage.local` mechanism. It is never transmitted or exposed beyond the user's device except for the single license verification request to Lemon Squeezy's secure API endpoint.
  </p>

  <h2>6. User Control</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You may delete your license information at any time by clicking the “Log out” button within the extension.</li>
    <li>Removing the extension from Chrome will erase all local data.</li>
    <li>No server-side data is retained by us.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Compliance</h2>
  <p>
    This extension adheres to Chrome Web Store policies and is designed to comply with applicable privacy laws, including GDPR and CCPA, to the extent that such regulations apply. Since no data is transmitted to us or stored externally, your use of the Extension is private and local.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this policy from time to time. Any updates will be reflected on this page with a revised effective date. Continued use of the Extension constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Contact</h2>
